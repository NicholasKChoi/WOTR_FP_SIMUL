# How to Google
When I graduated college and started my job, I had to trained in the ways of Google. Mostly
this was in the context of doing work on stuff that I had no idea what to do, and so I would
spend like, 2-3 hours googling the same topic, trying to learn about. And then I'd tell my boss
that I couldn't it out, and then, he'd ask if I tried googling it.

And then he'd try, and he'd get the answer in like 10 minutes.

And after that happened a couple times, he told me to **write down things as I google'd them**.


# Step by Step

## 1) Make a new document with your question at the top
So for each question you're googling, you're going to have 1 document. I put these in google drive,
but will just add them to the project here so that they are available as examples in the future.

## 2) Make a sub heading with exactly your google search term
Potentially link here as well, but the idea is to not spend a bunch of time cycling between 2-3 search terms.
Cycling back to the same search term later is a huge waste of time, and worse, it's one of the ways to make
the process go on forever. 

## 3) Look for interesting pages and make a sub-sub heading with the link to that page
Use the summaries to tell what pages are interesting given your question

Try to get through the first 5 links before moving on to the next search term.

## 4) Add notes on the page
Spend enough time doing this that you won't feel compelled to go back to it in the future, and have
enough in your notes that you don't have to repeat the search.

It's possible that the page is so long / complicated that it's not worth the time, that's actually a fine
note to take and then to come back to it later.


# Other Notes on the Process

## When do you stop?
When you can answer the question you started out with. Or you decide the question's answer isn't worth the effort. If it's the latter,
usually I'd add a little blurb at the top of the document explaining I spent "x" hours googling this, see results below, no answer, not worth it, come back 
to later if really desperate.

## What do you do when you give up?
Desperately try to think of other things that can get what you want but aren't your original question.

## What to do if you run out of things to google?

1. Try other search engines

# Philosophical Talking
Googling is research, it's not someone teaching you. The root of research is trial and error. So click everything until you develop a taste for what you think is good.
